            <h1>Welcome to My Personal Profile</h1>
            
            <p>Hello, my name is Joseph Kimani Thuo. I am passionate about solving local challenges in Kenya through technology.
            I am currently learning front-end web development and am excited to build user-friendly applications that tackle 
            everyday problems.</p>
            
            <h2>My Journey as a Developer</h2>
            <p>Starting my development journey with ALX has been a thrilling experience. From learning Git commands to building web pages like this one, I have 
            been able to grow my technical skills while applying them to real-world scenarios. I am determined to become a full-stack developer and contribute
            to the tech ecosystem in Kenya.</p>
            
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am currently working on several projects, including a mobile application aimed at making payment of fines easier and more transparent in Kenya. 
            I believe in using technology to address corruption and streamline governance processes. This project is in the user research phase, and I am looking forward to its development.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond development, I am interested in becoming a digital nomad. Traveling while working on impactful projects will allow me to 
            gain exposure to diverse perspectives, making my solutions even more effective. I am always on the lookout for new learning opportunities and collaborations.</p>
